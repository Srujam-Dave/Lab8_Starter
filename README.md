### Graceful Degradation and ServiceWorkers

Just like we discussed in class, graceful degradation is a programming approach that first focuses on the interactivity (Javascript) of an application first, and then secondarily focuses on the layout, structure, and formatting (HTML, CSS). ServiceWorkers are essential to making sure the user expereince in an app is maintained even while interactivity is prioritized. In other words, even when networks are slow and ineffective, ServiceWorkers provide a default experience, making the app less vulnerable to bugs. While progressive enhancement gives apps a default structure regardless of interactivity and networking, ServiceWorkers allow apps built through graceful degradation to have similar resilience.
